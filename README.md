## Learnings

I learned how to work with Leaflet and also used this project as an opportunity to work with external APIs which is something I haven't done in a long time.

Most of all, I learned how to correctly access the values stored in a .env file using React. After getting so many errors from using " process.env.WHATEVER_IS_STORED_THERE", I finally learned that firstly, "process" is not defined. I needed to use "import.meta.env.WHATEVER_IS_STORED_THERE". I also learned that using a REACT app created with VITE, I also needed to add the word "VITE" to the values stored in my env file. I finally accessed it as " import.meta.env.VITE_WHATEVER_IS_STORED_THERE".

Lastly, This is the first time i'm writing a README file for my project, so, It's a plus to the learning aspect.
